# Sliding Door for Ultimaker 2/2+

This is a set of runners that bolt to the Ultimaker 2+ so that a 3mm acrylic sheet can be used as a vertical sliding door. It does require the use of the Ultimaker bolts so may void your warranty.

The files in this folder have a 2mm gap between the desk and when the runner starts. This should be enough, but can be increased if needed with the "floorOffset" variable in OpenSCAD.

** Regular (non-extended) Ultimaker runners untested.
** Sizes other than 3mm untested.

## 3D Printed Parts

The stl files are for 3mm Acrylic. If you wish to use another thickness modify the Build.bat file (or the scad file and build manually).

Change the variable: acrylicWidth 
It should include a tollerance for your acrylic (3mm is often 3.5 in places) and a tollerance to allow it to slide (e.g. 0.5mm on the Ultimaker for PLA appears to work well), hence a 4.0 value for 3mm Acrylic.

the -Both files include both left and right for either the lower sections or the upper sections, this takes about 6 hours to print.

-Left and -Right files include individual left and right sections if you with to print them individually.

A small gap is left at the base to keep the runners clear of the desk top.

Lower sections include a stop block at the bottom to prevent the door from going below the level of the Ultimaker box which may hinder ventilation to the electronics mounted underneath the UM.
