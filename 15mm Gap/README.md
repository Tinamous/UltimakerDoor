# Sliding Door for Ultimaker 2/2+

This is a set of runners that bolt to the Ultimaker 2+ so that a 3mm acrylic sheet can be used as a vertical sliding door. It does require the use of the Ultimaker bolts so may void your warranty.

The files in this folder have a 15mm offset from the desk to allow for feet to be placed around the ultimaker to hold it in place.
